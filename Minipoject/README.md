# Mini_Project-C-Playfair-cipher

Project description

The Play-fair algorithm is based on the use of a 5 Ã— 5 matrix of letters constructed using a keyword. The matrix is constructed by filling in the letters of the keyword (minus duplicates) from left to right and from top to bottom, and then filling in the remainder of the matrix with the remaining letters in alphabetic order. The letters I and J count as one letter.
